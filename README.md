Sharing my pesonal debian bookworm server build.

1st off I am no coder or even programmer. Most if not all code is pulled from somewhere off the net from help sites or examples from other comunitties.
That being said feel free to make suggestions for improvements or better way to code something being done, I sometimes take the simple way around a problem.
I have setup the main user as media and password as bookworm (already breaking the rule). I built the last version on Bookworm 12.4 on a VM with user media and pass bookworm. These are used 
troughout the install and for logins and will need change to suit your needs. I have included a preseed file which includes git in the repo to build the debian build envoirment, for this I just boot the netiso 
into the vm and point it at the preseed file by switching to the help menu on the iso boot and suppling auto url=. After the net install is done clone the repo and run 

The orginal concept started years ago when I first started getting into media servers / torrents / nzb readers etc
