Sharing my pesonal debian bookworm server build.

1st off I am no coder or even programmer. Most if not all code is pulled from somewhere off the net from help sites or examples from other comunitties.
That being said feel free to make suggestions for improvements or better way to code something being done

The orginal concept started years ago when I first started getting into media servers / torrents / nzb readers etc
